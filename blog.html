					<br>
					A Library for Building User Interfaces
				</h3>

					ReactJS is a JavaScript library that lets you create interactive and reusable components for your web
					applications. ReactJS is based on the concept of a virtual DOM, which means that it only updates the parts of
					the UI that have changed, making it fast and efficient. ReactJS also supports JSX, a syntax extension that
					allows you to write HTML-like code in JavaScript.
					<br>
					<br>
					Some of the benefits of using ReactJS are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							It is easy to learn and use, especially if you are familiar with JavaScript and HTML.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							It has a large and active community that provides many resources, tools, and libraries to enhance your
							development experience.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							It is compatible with other frameworks and libraries, such as Angular, Vue, or Redux, giving you more
							flexibility and choice.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							It is suitable for building complex and dynamic web applications that need to handle user interactions,
							data changes, and state management.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If you want to get started with ReactJS, you can follow

					<a href="https://react.dev/">
						the official tutorial
					</a>

					or

					<a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html">
						check out some of the examples on the React website.
					</a>

					You can also use

					<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/react/default.asp">
						create-react-app
					</a>

					, a tool that sets up a modern React project for you with no configuration.

				<h3>ElectronJS:
					<br>
					A Framework for Building Cross-Platform Desktop Apps
				</h3>

				<p>
					ElectronJS is a framework that allows you to build desktop applications using web technologies, such as HTML,
					CSS, and JavaScript. ElectronJS combines Chromium, the engine behind Google Chrome, and Node.js, a runtime
					environment for JavaScript, to enable you to access native features and APIs of the operating system.
					<br>
					<br>
					Some of the advantages of using ElectronJS are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							It is based on web technologies, which means that you can use your existing web development skills and
							tools to create desktop apps.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							It is cross-platform, which means that you can build and run your apps on Windows, macOS, and Linux,
							without having to write different code for each platform.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							It is open source and has a large and supportive community that contributes to the development and
							maintenance of the framework and provides many resources, tutorials, and modules to help you with your
							projects.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							It is used by many popular and successful apps, such as VS Code, Slack, Discord, and Spotify,
							demonstrating its reliability and performance.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<P>
					If you want to learn more about ElectronJS, you can visit the
					<a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">
						official website
					</a>
					or
					<a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest">
						read the documentation.
					</a>
					You can also use
					<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">
						Electron Forge
					</a>
					, a tool that helps you create, run, and publish Electron apps with ease.

				<h3>TypeScript:
					<br>
					JavaScript with Syntax for Types
				</h3>
				<figure>
					<img
						src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Typescript_logo_2020.svg/800px-Typescript_logo_2020.svg.png"

				<p>TypeScript is a programming language that extends JavaScript by adding syntax for types. TypeScript is a
					superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript
					compiles to plain JavaScript, which can run on any browser or platform that supports JavaScript.
					<br>
					<br>
					Some of the reasons to use TypeScript are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							It provides type checking and error detection at compile time, which can help you catch bugs and write
							more robust and maintainable code.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							It offers better tooling and editor support, such as auto-completion, refactoring, and documentation,
							which can improve your productivity and code quality.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							It supports modern JavaScript features, such as classes, modules, and arrow functions, as well as
							experimental features, such as decorators, async/await, and optional chaining, allowing you to write more
							expressive and concise code.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							It is compatible with existing JavaScript libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue,
							giving you access to a rich and diverse ecosystem of web development tools.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If you want to try out TypeScript, you can use the
					<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/">
						online playground
					</a>
					or
					<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/index.php">
						install it via npm.
					</a>
					You can also
					<a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html">
						read the handbook
					</a>
					or
					<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/">
						the tutorials
					</a>
					to learn the basics and advanced concepts of TypeScript.
