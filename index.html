					But this blog isn't just about me. It's about building a community of developers who can learn from each other
					and

					something
					great together!
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to web development, I'll also be sharing my thoughts on related topics such as software
					engineering,
					user experience design, and project management. I believe that a well-rounded developer is a better developer,
					so
					I
					encourage you to explore these topics as well.
